The Confidants Organised to Mentor Recently Admitted Doctoral Economics Students (COMRADES) program is a mentorship program with the intent of helping first-year PhD students integrate into the UC San Diego Economics department and life in San Diego. Eric Reinelt and Sam Krumholtz initiated the program in 2015, after which Sarah Zeng took responsibility and modified the program for the subsequent years up to today. The program seeks to foster friendships within the department while supporting our newest members. Some of the outcomes of this program include increased communication across the graduate students, better provision of educational resources, improved mental health, and reduced isolation for students with niche interests or backgrounds. The newest coordinator for the COMRADES program is Anjali Pai (as of Fall 2020).
