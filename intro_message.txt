For the month of September, you each have $5 ($10 total) to spend on coffee or froyo or any other kind of bonding consumption good (except alcohol, sorry!). To submit a reimbursement, please take a photo of your itemised receipt and send it to {} with the string "COMRADES" in the subject line.

Cheers,
Sarah
